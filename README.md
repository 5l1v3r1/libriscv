## Installing a RISC-V GCC linux compiler

To get C++ exceptions and other things, you will need a (limited) Linux userspace environment. You will need to build this cross-compiler yourself:

```
git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
./configure --prefix=$HOME/riscv --with-arch=rv32gc --with-abi=ilp32
make -j4
```
This will build a newlib cross-compiler with C++ exception support.

Note how the ABI is ilp32 and not ilp32d, which requires full floating-point support. Support is only halfway complete, and it is recommended to instead rely on the compiler to simulate this support for now.

Note that if you want a full glibc cross-compiler instead, simply appending `linux` to the make command will suffice, like so: `make linux`. Glibc is harder to support, and produces larger binaries, but will be more performant. It also supports threads, which is awesome to play around with.

## Building and running a test program

From one of the binary subfolders:
```
$ ./build.sh
```
Which will produce a `hello_world` binary in the sub-projects build folder.

Building the emulator (starting from project root) and booting the newlib `hello_world`:
```sh
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. && make -j4
./remu ../binaries/newlib/build/hello_world
```

Building and running your own ELF files that can run in freestanding RV32GC is quite challenging, so consult the `barebones` example! It's a bit like booting on bare metal, except you can more easily implement system functions. The fun part is of course the extremely small binaries and total control over the environment.

The `newlib` example project have much more C and C++ support, but still misses things like environment variables and such. This is a deliberate design as newlib is intended for embedded development. It supports C++ RTTI and exceptions, and is the best middle-ground for running a fuller C++ environment that still produces small binaries.

The `full` example project uses the Linux-configured cross compiler and will expect you to implement quite a few system calls just to get into `int main()`. In addition, you will have to setup argv, env and the aux-vector. There is a helper method to do this in the src folder. If you want to implement threads to really get to all the fun stuff (like the coming C++20 coroutines), then this is where you can do that, as newlib simply won't enable threads.

And finally, the `micro` project implements the absolutely minimal freestanding RV32GC C/C++ environment. You don't have any heap, so no new/delete. And you can't printf values because you don't have a C standard library, so you can only write constant strings using the write system call. Still, the stripped binary is only 712 bytes, and will execute only 77 instructions running the whole program!

## Instruction set support

The emulator currently supports RV32IMAC, however the foundation is laid for RV64IM.
The F and D-extensions are halfway supported (32- and 64-bit floating point instructions).

## Usage

Load a binary and let the machine simulate from `_start` (ELF entry-point):
```C++
#include <libriscv/machine.hpp>

template <int W>
long syscall_exit(riscv::Machine<W>& machine)
{
	printf(">>> Program exited, exit code = %d\n", machine.template sysarg<int> (0));
	machine.stop();
	return 0;
}

int main(int argc, const char** argv)
{
	const auto binary = <load your RISC-V ELF binary here>;

	riscv::Machine<riscv::RISCV32> machine { binary };
	// install a system call handler
	machine.install_syscall_handler(93, syscall_exit<riscv::RISCV32>);

	// add program arguments on the stack
	std::vector<std::string> args = {
		"hello_world", "test!"
	};
	machine.setup_argv(args);

	// this function will run until the exit syscall has stopped the machine
	// or an exception happens which stops execution
	machine.simulate();
}
```

You can find details on the Linux system call ABI online as well as in the `syscalls.hpp` header in the src folder. You can use this header to make syscalls from your RISC-V programs. It is emulating the Linux RISC-V syscall ABI.

Be careful about modifying registers during system calls, as it may cause problems
in the simulated program.

## Calling into the VM environment

It's possible to make function calls into the environment, but there are a handful of things that need to be taken care of in order to do that. First off, you should not return from `int main()`, as that will call global destructors which will make the C run-time environment unreliable. Instead, one should call `_exit(status)` from `int main()`, which immediately exits the machine, but does not call global destructors and free resources.

It is not unsafe to call `_exit()` or any other equivalent function directly, as all it does is invoke the EXIT system call, which immediately stops execution of the program. In a normal operating system this also makes the execution environment (usually a process) disappear, and releases all the resources back. In this case we just want to preserve the machine state (which is in a good known state) while also stopping execution, so that we can call into the programs functions directly.

Once the machine is no longer running, but still left in a state in which we can call into it, we have to make sure that our callable function in the VM is present in the symbol table of the ELF, so that we can find the address of this function. In addition, `_exit` must also be present in the ELF symbol tables, as it will be used as a way to exit the VM call and also optionally return a status code. This is done via hooking up the exit system call behind the scenes and extracting the exit status code after execution stops.

A third, and final, stumbling block is sometimes having functions, even those marked with `__attribute__((used))`, not appearing in the ELF symbol table, which is a linker issue. This can happen when using `-gc-sections` and friends. You can test if your symbol is visible to the emulator by using `machine.memory.resolve_address("myFunction")` which returns a memory address. If the address is 0, then the name was not found in the symbol table, which makes `vmcall(...)` impossible to perform.

Start by running the machine normally and complete `int main()` to make sure global constructors are called and the C run-time environment is fully initialized. So, if you are calling `_exit(0)` from main instead of returning, and not stripping ELF symbols from your binary you are ready to make function calls into the virtual machine.

Example which calls the function `test` with the arguments `555` and `666`:
```C++
	int ret = machine.vmcall("test", {555, 666});
	printf("test returned %d\n", ret);
```
Arguments are passed as a C++ initializer list of register-sized integers.

Instruction counters and registers are not reset on calling functions, so make sure to take that into consideration when measuring.

It is not recommended to copy data into guest memory and then pass pointers to this data as arguments, as it's a very complex task to determine which memory is unused by the guest before and even during the call. Instead, the guest can allocate room for the struct on its own, and then simply perform a system call where it passes a pointer to the struct as an argument.

## Why a RISC-V library

It's a drop-in sandbox.Â Perhaps you want someone to be able to execute C/C++ code on a website, safely?

See the `webapi` folder for an example web-server that compiles and runs limited C/C++ code in a relatively safe manner. Ping me or create a PR if you notice something is exploitable.

Note that the web API demo uses a docker container to build RISC-V binaries, for security reasons. You can build the container with `docker build -t newlib-rv32gc . -f newlib.Dockerfile` from the docker folder. Alternatively, you could build a more full-fledged Linux environment using `docker build -t linux-rv32gc . -f linux.Dockerfile`. There is a test-script to see that it works called `dbuild.sh` which takes an input code file and output binary as parameters.
